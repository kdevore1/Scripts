calculate_2D_poses.py should be ran on the workstation in order to generate csv files containing the poses for each particle.
This script will need to be refactored and run for every project/dataset.

Once csv files are generated, generate_histograms_2D.py should be ran to generate histograms of the pose information (in .png format). 
This script will also generate a .csv file containing the mean, standard deviation, and variance of each distribution.
This script will need to be refactored and run for every project/dataset.
